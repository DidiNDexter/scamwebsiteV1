# ISSUE NAME

Add contribution.md file

## ISSUE DESCRIPTION

The repository currently lacks a `contribution.md` file, which is essential for outlining contribution guidelines. This file will help guide new contributors in understanding how to contribute to the project, including the coding standards, commit message guidelines, and how to submit pull requests.

## APPROACH

1. **Create a `contribution.md` file:**  
   Add a new `contribution.md` file in the root directory of the project.
2. **Outline the following in the file:**

   - **Introduction:** A brief introduction about the project and welcoming new contributors.
   - **Code of Conduct:** Reference to the project's code of conduct (if available).
   - **How to contribute:** Steps on how contributors can propose new features, report bugs, or contribute code.
   - **Submitting a Pull Request:** Guidelines on how to fork the repository, make changes, write commit messages, and open pull requests.
   - **Coding standards:** Outline any specific code styles or linting rules contributors must follow.
   - **Tests:** Information on how to run tests, if applicable, and how to write new tests for contributed code.

3. **Finalize and test:**  
   Review the `contribution.md` to ensure all necessary guidelines are clear and comprehensive. Test that the instructions are easy to follow for new contributors.
